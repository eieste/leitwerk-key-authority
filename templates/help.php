					<dd>SSH key authority was able to open an SSH connection to your server, but the host key no longer matches the one that is on record for your server.  If this is expected (eg. your server has been migrated to a new host), you can reset the host key on the "Settings" page of your server.

					<dt>SFTP subsystem failed</dt>
					<dd>SSH key authority currently relies on SFTP in order to determine if an account's key file needs updating or not.  We are hoping to remove this dependency at some point, but for now your server needs to support SFTP (which openssh does by default) for key synchronization to work.</dd>

					<dd>
						SSH key authority could not write to at least one of the files in <code>/var/local/keys-sync</code> (or <code>/root/.ssh/authorized_keys2</code> for legacy sync).  This is typically caused by one of 3 possibilities:
						<ul>
							<li>Issues with file ownership - this directory and all files in it must be owned by the keys-sync user</li>
							<li>Read-only filesystem</li>
							<li>Disk full</li>
						</ul>

				<h5>Stage 1</h5>
				<p>If SSH Key Authority is reporting "Key directory does not exist" for your server, then Stage 1 is required.</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Create keys-sync account: <code>adduser --system --disabled-password --home /var/local/keys-sync --shell /bin/sh keys-sync</code>
					<li>Change the permissions of <code>/var/local/keys-sync</code> to 711: <code>chmod 0711 /var/local/keys-sync</code>
					<li>Create <code>/var/local/keys-sync/keys-sync</code> file (owned by keys-sync, permissions 0644) with the following SSH key in it:
						<pre><?php out($this->get('keys-sync-pubkey'))?></pre>
					</li>
					<?php if(isset($security_config['hostname_verification']) && $security_config['hostname_verification'] >= 3) { ?>
					<li>Create <code>/var/local/keys-sync/.hostnames</code> text file (owned by keys-sync, permissions 0644) with the server's hostname in it</li>
					<?php } ?>
				</ol>
				<h5>Verify Stage 1 success</h5>
				<p>Once Stage 1 has been deployed to your server, trigger a resync from SSH Key Authority. The server should no longer have the "Key directory does not exist" warning after syncing (the "Using legacy sync method" warning is expected at this point instead). You can check the contents of the <code>/var/local/keys-sync</code> directory to make sure that the access looks right.</p>
				<h5>Stage 2</h5>
				<ol>
					<li>
						Reconfigure SSH (<code>/etc/ssh/sshd_config</code>) to use:
						<ul>
							<li>"<code>AuthorizedKeysFile /var/local/keys-sync/%u</code>"
							<li>"<code>StrictModes no</code>"
						</ul>
					<li>Restart SSH server
				</ol>
				<p>This stage stops any .ssh/authorized_keys* files from having any effect and transfers login authentication authority over to the /var/local/keys-sync directory.</p>
				<p>After triggering a resync from SSH Key Authority, your server should be listed as "Synced successfully".</p>
