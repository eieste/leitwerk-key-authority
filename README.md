LKA - Leitwerk Key Authority
=======================

*Please see the [Security Advisories](#security-advisories) section below for a recently addressed security issue*

A tool for managing user and server SSH access to any number of servers.

Features
--------

* Easily manage SSH key access for all accounts on your servers.
* Manage user access and server-to-server access rules.
* Integrate with your LDAP directory service for user authorization.
* Automatically remove server access from people when they leave your team.
* Provides an easy interface for your users to upload their public keys.
* Designate server administrators and let them manage access to their own server.
* Create group-based access rules for easier management.
* Specify SSH access options such as `command=`, `nopty` etc on your access rules.
* All access changes are logged to the database and to the system logs. Granting of access is also reported by email.
* Be notified when a server becomes orphaned (has no active administrators).

Requirements
------------

* An LDAP directory service
* Apache 2.2 or higher
* PHP 5.6 or higher
* PHP JSON extension
* PHP LDAP extension
* PHP mbstring (Multibyte String) extension
* PHP MySQL extension
* PHP ssh2 extension
* MySQL (5.5+), Percona Server (5.5+) or MariaDB database

Installation
------------

1.  Clone the repo somewhere outside of your default Apache document root.

2.  Add the following directives to your Apache configuration (eg. virtual host config):

        DocumentRoot /path/to/lka/public_html
        DirectoryIndex init.php
        FallbackResource /init.php

3.  Create a MySQL user and database (run in MySQL shell):

        CREATE USER 'lka-user'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
        CREATE DATABASE `lka-db` DEFAULT CHARACTER SET utf8mb4;
        GRANT ALL ON `lka-db`.* to 'lka-user'@'localhost';

4.  Copy the file `config/config-sample.ini` to `config/config.ini` and edit the settings as required.

5.  Set up authnz_ldap for your virtual host (or any other authentication module that will pass on an Auth-user
    variable to the application).

6.  Set `scripts/ldap_update.php` to run on a regular cron job.

7.  Generate an SSH key pair to synchronize with. Leitwerk Key Authority will expect to find the files as `config/keys-sync` and `config/keys-sync.pub` for the private and public keys respectively.

8.  Install the SSH key synchronization daemon. For systemd:

    1.  Copy `services/systemd/keys-sync.service` to `/etc/systemd/system/`
    2.  Modify `ExecStart` path and `User` as necessary. If Leitwerk Key Authority is installed under `/home`, disable `ProtectHome`.
    3.  `systemctl daemon-reload`
    4.  `systemctl enable keys-sync.service`

    for sysv-init:

    1.  Copy `services/init.d/keys-sync` to `/etc/init.d/`
    2.  Modify `SCRIPT` path and `USER` as necessary.
    3.  `update-rc.d keys-sync defaults`

Usage
-----

Anyone in the LDAP group defined under `admin_group_cn` in `config/config.ini` will be able to manage accounts and servers.

Key distribution
----------------

Leitwerk Key Authority distributes authorized keys to your servers via SSH. It does this by:

1.  Connecting to the server with SSH, authorizing as the `keys-sync` user.
2.  Writing the appropriate authorized keys to named user files in `/var/local/keys-sync/` (eg. all authorized keys for the root user will be written to `/var/local/keys-sync/root`).

This means that your SSH installation will need to be reconfigured to read authorized keys from `/var/local/keys-sync/`.

Please note that doing so will deny access to any existing SSH public key authorized in the default `~/.ssh` directories.

Under OpenSSH, the configuration changes needed are:

    AuthorizedKeysFile /var/local/keys-sync/%u
    StrictModes no

StrictModes must be disabled because the files will all be owned by the keys-sync user.

The file `/var/local/keys-sync/keys-sync` must exist, with the same contents as the `config/keys-sync.pub` file in order for the synchronization daemon to authenticate.
